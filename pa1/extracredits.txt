Completed the Edit Distance and made search work gracefully.

I used the Levenshtein function in PHP, as well as checking if the
search word was contained in any of the players names.
If the distance between the words in the Levenshtein function was not 0 (which would mean it was a perfect match) then I printed the closest player to the search.3
